        <h1 className="left clean-header display-header">Hi, I'm Noah Carlson</h1>
        <p> 
        I am a graduated Computer Science student at the University of Utah and am currently looking for career opportunities. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Over my time at the University of Utah I have been able to work on a variety of projects that have allowed me to explore my interests in
        computer science. I have worked on projects ranging from web development to machine learning and have found that the
        creativity and problem solving excites me and is what drives me to accomplish my next project. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Along with the software development problems I have also constantly practiced setting goals and working tirelessly to achieve them.
        I was a competitive swimmer for over a decade and my long-term goal had always been to be a member of a fast Division 1 Swim team.
        After 6 years of training and competing I earned the opportunity to try-out to walk-on to the NCAA Men's Utah Swim and Dive team. 
        Once I made the team, I worked to prove that I belonged on the team and eventually in one
        of my events I went the 8th fastest time in the history of Utah Swim and Dive.
        </p>
        <p>
        That is just a short testiment to my work ethic and what I can achieve including this website!
        So, thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoy!
